# Implementation Language

We have decided to use CPython 3 as our implementation language for various
reasons: 
- It contains modules that can automatically serialize and parse any code that
  we generate into pyc files
- The CPython version we use will provide information about op codes and other
  useful information for generating code
- The focus of this class is to explore the fundamental concepts that are
  required for a compiler.  Using Python allows us to focus only on the details
  that matter
