# Parser Pointers

## Source Code

All source code is located under the `src` directory.

`javapyc.py` is the main entry point into the compiler.  To only parse MiniJava,
instruct javapyc to stop at the parse phase with the `-p parse` switch.  For
example, to parse our fibonacci test case, run the following from the `src`
directory:

    $ ./javapyc.py -p parse tests/fib.java

Code relevant to our parser can be found in `ast.py` and `parser.py`.  The
former is used solely to represent our abstract syntax tree, while the latter
will inject any needed parsing functionality into the ast nodes.

## Sample Output

The sample input and output for the parser can be found under `output/parser`.
Any `.java` file that has an associated `.out` file should generate that output
if ran through javapyc, and any file that does not have an associated output
file should fail due to the java input file being invalid.
